I am being developing OpenSource tecnhology and knowledge for electric bicycles (2008 - 2019) and many developers joined the project, making it a success -- bicycles usage did grow worldwide and will keep growing so more and more users will take advantage of our work.

My vision is to develop OpenSource tecnhology and knowledge for an eletric legs / exoskeleton so the users can walk and run faster and so go more to outside and do sports or go to work, while the tecnhology can also help to reduce the injuries due to impacts on knees and spine.
